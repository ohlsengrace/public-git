Pinventory
-----------------------
In Fall 2020, I was enrolled in the Capstone Development team at my high school. Our team consisted of 6 people. Each year, the team creates a project that benefits the district.

The administration came to us saying that they were struggling with a lack of infrastruture for tracking textbooks. With Covid and online school, books were given out and not kept track of. The district lost an unknown, probably alarming, amount of money from textbooks that were unaccounted for at the end of the year. They wanted a change from the pen and paper tracking system that they had been using. They communicated their need for a system that was quick and effective.

For the administration and school district, the Capstone team came up with Pinventory.

Pinventory is a web-based textbook inventory system that has 5 components...

- The ability to put new sets of textbooks as well as import previously purchased into the system. Each textbook set is distinguished by an ISBN and each individual textbook is distinguished by a unique ID that included the ISBN of its parent set. When a textbook set is entered into the system, a PDF of the corresponding individual barcodes is served back to the client. The PDF was formatted so that it could be printed out on to a sticker paper and placed on the textbook.
- The ability to check out books to students. Come the beginning of the school year, teachers simply plug in a scanner to their laptop and open the check out page while each student comes up with their textbooks. One textbook at a time, the teacher scans the unique student ID and the unique textbook barcode. This is put into the textbook system and a message of completion or error flashes on the screen. The interface is very simple so that checking out can be done in quick procession.
- The ability to check in books. To check in a book, all the teacher has to do is scan the textbook barcode and the student no longer has ownership of it according to the database.
- The ability to search for books. Teachers or administrators can go in and search books by student ID, book ID, textbook name, department (English, History, etc...), and year. This can be used to search for students who still have books checked out so fines can be applied accordingly.
- The ability for students to see which books they have checked out. Students have their own view of the website where they can only access what textbooks they currently have checked out. 

The project was a great success and is currently being used by my highschool.



My Role 
-----------------------
For this project, I was assigned as the head of the backend dev team. The team consisted of me and two other seniors. As a team we ran into many challenges including but not limited to...

- Not knowing how to start. For this class, we weren't given much assistance from our teacher and he served as a supervisor rather than an instructor of our learning. It was a steep learning curve to not only learn JavaScript and become familiar with new technologies, but we had no idea how the infrastructure of a backend was supposed to look like or how it was supposed to act. It took a lot of research,YouTube videos, Stack Overflow, coffee, and trial and error to get our project off the ground. 
- Collaborating as a team in a long-term project. Personally, I had played sports my whole life leading up to the project but had never been on a team in an academic sense. Adapting to work with and have to lead others for a project like this was also difficult. Over the course of the year, our team read The Five Dysfunctions of A Team by Patrick Lencioni and Thanks For the Feedback by Douglas Stone to assist in this new group dynamic.
- Learning how to use other people's code. There is a lot of looking up code from the Internet that can occur when writing these types of programs. This can include code from StackOverflow, tutorials, code from public libraries... What I found is that it's fine to pull from the work of others, but it's crucial that you know how and why you're doing it. If all you did was simply copy and paste throughout the whole code, your project is patchy and may not work the way you think it does. I found that learning how to read documentation with a purpose, being critical of others' code, and being critical of my own code was a really difficult set of skills that I had to fine tune over the course of the project. 

The programming languages I learned during this project are JavaScript and SQL.
The tools I learned to use during this project include NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Eclipse (IDE), WebStorm (IDE), PdfKit, Google Libraries (login tokens and such...), React, GitHub, Trello, Slack, and a little bit of AWS (my teacher handled most of that).

This project was a huge challenge but definitely the highlight of my senior year. I feel that the technical and interpersonal experience it has brought me puts me lightyears ahead of my peers. And I'm really grateful and fortunate to have received the opportunity to be on this team.


If you have any questions about the project, feel free to email or message me. My contact is on the README file in the main repository. 
I can also give you the email of my teacher as well if you have any questions for him about my role in the project or the Capstone program.
